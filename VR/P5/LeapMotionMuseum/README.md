# Julien's Leap Motion Museum

This VR project is my first project using the HTC vive Sdk on unity.

# Leap Motion Museum

This is a simple VR experience to present the Leap Motion controller.

#The Result

The demo consist of 5 stations presenting different aspects and use cases of the leap motion controller.
You navigate between the stations riding on a hovering desk, by pressing the left or right triggers of the controller.
Some stations present videos, while others are simple text and images. 

##Breakdown of the final application

Here are few screenshots of the result of the project.

Pulling on the left trigger moves the desk to the left

When the images appear and when the desk moves, some audio files are played.

##Conclusion

The project runs correctly and is easy enough for a beginner in VR to have a fun experience.

##Next steps

As a next iteration, playing with teleport move would probably give a better experience.
Also being able to interact with the desk console elements would be interesting.
